		<p>Hi there! This is Jinghan Zhang and known as Hailey by my friends :) 
			I'm currently a first year graduate student studying UX design and HCI in MSI program in University of Michigan. 
			As a growing human-centered designer, I hope to use meaningful designs to promote individual 
			self-growth and positive social impact. To name one, division and polarization 
			between people, groups and communities on the internet is one of the issues that I strive to address.</p>
			
		<p>Of course, when I am not brainstorming on designs, you can catch me listening 
			to hiphop music from Post Malone and Travis Scott, playing Legend of Zelda on 
			Nintendo switch and cooking delicious potato dishes!.</p>
