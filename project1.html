		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Launchit is a website dedicated to integrate available resources to connect students 
			with extracurricular opportunities and peers with similar interests. This platform 
			aims at streamlining the process of finding opportunities and recruiting teammates 
			as well as breaking the walls between majors and fields. Engineering students who 
			have brilliant ideas for projects now can recruit teammates with a business 
			backgrounds. In addition, professors and leaders from organizations can also 
			utilize this platform to recurit members. Launchit itself is a team project in 
			which I collaborated with other engineers, designers and researchers at school. 
			As one of the UI/UX designers in the team, my role is to conduct user research, 
			create wireframes and design prototypes for the product. </p>
		
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<!-- Make sure your anchor tags have a link (href) and a clickable component -->
		<p>On college campuses, extracurricular involvement is a crucial and indispensable 
			component of studentâ€™s college experiences. Students become involved in 
			extracurricular activities not only for entertainment and social purposes. 
			but more important, to gain and improve skills. However, these extracurricular 
			activities are not very visible and easy to find for students since many of 
			them are scattered in different mediums and platforms, including email, 
			websites, social media and so on. From my own experience and observation as 
			a college student, the process of searching and communicating for a certain 
			opportunity takes a lot of efforts and time. The whole process often takes 
			weeks and months to find one suitable and interesting opportunity to participate.</p>
